Laravel security update and bugfixes

v4.4.4 updates the core framework version to **v6.20.16** which introduces major updates in the way cookies and sessions are stored and maintained. Since the update fixes some security vulnerabilities in session and cookie management of the framework it's recommended to update the Faveo system to v4.4.4 immediately. This release also fixes some pesky bugs which were ruining your experience with the system.

We have squashed the critical bug we found in the last release. Workflow, SLA and listeners will be working without errors now.

|====================================================
|   v4.3.0
|====================================================
We have bundled various enhancements and feature updates in v4.3.0 to make the Faveo Helpdesk better and more useful for businesses to support their customer issues in a better-organized manner. Along with new updates, v4.3.0 also provides patches for various pesky bugs.

### Updates
- #### Form Builder updates
The custom form builder is an essential and critical module of Faveo that allows customizing the system as per your industry and gather all required information from your customers so that agents can solve the issues effectively and efficiently. We have made various improvements in the Form builder components that work behind the scenes in the system. Though we do not have anything to show off for Form Builder using screenshots or screencast GIFs but rest assured the Form builder has improved a lot.

* #### Distinct Ticket Activity logs
In Faveo, agents and clients can perform various actions on the ticket other than replying to the tickets. Though Faveo already had logs for maintaining all such activities performed by different users on the tickets but those logs were very basic and showed limited information. It somewhat helped to analyze the actions taken on the tickets but still resulted in ambiguity and confusion to identify all changes on the tickets and what caused them. 
Keeping all these challenges in mind we are releasing better and more detailed **Ticket activity logs** which help to identify those changes. These new activity logs can support to identify
&nbsp;&nbsp;  * Which workflows/listeners were enforced on the tickets.
&nbsp;&nbsp;  * Which update caused the SLA update
 
Additionally, we have moved all activities logs into different tab that removes the noise from the timeline of conversations and helps agents to focus on replies made by clients or other agents.
![ticket-activity-log](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/102046024-7348b900-3e00-11eb-83ff-90df30013046.gif)


- #### Improved file manager
We have changed the file manager used in the system to attach or upload attachments on the tickets, Knowledge base articles, and other places in the system. Now when you upload a file using the "Add media" or "Attachment" option new file manager will appear as shown in the image below
![Screenshot 2020-12-14 at 10 59 58 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/102043899-b18fa980-3dfb-11eb-8e68-20b158671a79.png)
As you can see in the image above the new file manager is full of rich options that allow you to handle user uploaded files and attachments in the system in a better way. 


- #### Admin panel Vue conversion
To achieve our goal to make Faveo faster and optimized. We are continuously working on implementing the latest technologies in the system. After converting the client panel of Faveo into Vue we are now transferring our focus to converting agent and admin into Vue so we can provide the same seamless experience to the agents who actually use the system day in and day out to serve your business. This update converts various settings pages in the Admin panel into Vue.

### Bug fixes
 * Azure users are unable to login.
 * Select fields options ordering issue.
 * Teams data table does not show teams that do not have any lead.
 * Admin panel settings and sidebar mismatch.
 * System email appears in the agent list select options.
 * Various UI and other minor issues.

|   v4.2.0
|====================================================
In this version, we have updated our editor interface and changes our WYSIWYG editor to [TinyMCE Community](https://www.tiny.cloud/get-tiny/self-hosted) for a better experience so your agents can maintain KB articles and express themselves creatively. Along with this it also fixes various minor bugs that do not break your system but still give us nightmares.

### Updates
- TinyMCE Editor added
TinyMCE is a widely used rich text editor on the internet. We have added TinyMCE editor to enhance your experience so you can format your reply to clients, KB articles, and most places that use text area as you like.

NOTE: As the editor has been changed you might encounter few changes while editing existing KB articles. So we request you to check all the Articles and save their image

- Active Directory location mapping
Now LDAP plugin integration allows you to map users with their AD location in Faveo. So the location of users can also be imported and mapped in the system via LDAP.

- CRTWorkflow Plugin
CRTWorkflow is short for creating tickets via workflow. This plugin allows the admin to create new tickets via workflow. It links recur tickets with workflow so when it is enabled admin can select the recur tickets in workflow action. If the workflow with recur action gets enforced system will create new tickets with the details available in the recur ticket.

|====================================================
|   v4.1.0
|====================================================
Following the updates, in v4.0 we have updated the looks and style of the Faveo UI by updating the frontend theme AdminLTE to the latest version. Faveo v4.1.0 also updates bootstrap and other UI libraries being used in the system. It also provides fixes for some major bugs in the system.

### Updates
- #### New look for admin and agent panel
v4.1.0 updates AdminLTE and bootstrap version which changes the look of the system. Though all the elements are at the same place as before the update in the theme makes them look new and more interesting.
- #### Manage tasks via workflow
Now you can create and append tasks on the ticket using workflows. In workflow action, you can define to link a ticket with a set of tasks that are enforced if the ticket satisfies the certain conditions and rules you set in the workflow.
- #### Update tags/labels and requester via workflow
Similarly, we have added new actions in the workflow which allows you to add new tags/labels and also update the requester of the ticket using workflows. 
- #### Search requester with organisation name
Now you can search requester based on the organization they are from. So if you know someone is from an organization called "Google" in the system but you do not recall their name while creating the ticket you can simply type "Google" in the requester field and you will be provided with the list of all the members of that organization in the system.
- #### Attach Assets on ticket creation
If you use ServiceDesk to manage your IT assets, many times you want to mention an asset or link an asset with the ticket which has the issues. While in the older version you had to link the assets after creating the ticket. This update provides a field called "Assets" in the ticket form which allows users to link the assets on the ticket while creating a ticket.
- #### Reply to tweets
Twitter plugin update now allows you to reply back to tweets directed to your account from the system. 
- #### Add description during forwarding a ticket
Now you can add a custom description and also forward the attachment of the ticket while forwarding tickets.

Custom plugin for alliance broadband no more details required in release notes related to it.

### Bug fixes

For technical changelog see https://github.com/ladybirdweb/faveo-helpdesk-advance/blob/master/ChangeLogs.md#v410

|====================================================
|   v4.0.1
|====================================================
In v4.0.0 we had updated the Laravel framework's version to v6.18.34 which had some breaking changes the way the framework handles cookies and auth sessions. Which was causing the issues during auto-updating the application from older versions to v4.0.0. This release is a hotfix which fixes this issue by downgrading the Laravel version to v6.18.26 which is the last stable release for non-breaking changes.

### Bug fixes
- #### Auto-update failure due to session/cookie expiration fixed
Due to breaking changes in the framework updating the application from the auto-update module without taking backup results in the failure of the update. 

- #### Auto-update failure due to reCaptcha settings in the older versions
Additionally, if you had added reCaptcha in the older system and removed/deactivated, it again causes the failure in the update of the application.

- #### Recurring tickets do not create tickets
While creating recur tickets if you select start and end time as the same date then the system was failing to create the recurring tickets.

For technical changelog see https://github.com/ladybirdweb/faveo-helpdesk-advance/blob/master/ChangeLogs.md#v401


|====================================================
|   v4.0.0
|====================================================
This release introduces various major changes and improvements in the system. It updates the implementation of various modules to implement the correct business logic and remove any issues in the module.
As v4.0.0 suggests, this release contains various major changes which are backward-incompatible. So after updating to this version you will not be able to downgrade the system to the older versions.

## Updates

### Laravel Updates
Laravel framework has been updated to the latest releases version of the framework for v6.

### Facebook Plugin 2.0
Facebook plugin v2 has been developed which uses the latest messenger APIs for fetching the ticket and replying on the tickets and post reply back to Facebook.
In the older version, the old API and access permission for the APIs were misleading, and getting the approval for the Facebook app to use with Faveo was a tedious task. This new implementation with v7 APIs makes the process faster and less likely for your apps to get disapproved by the Facebook team.
This update also lets supports media attachment fetching in the ticket from Facebook. Ticket will be fetched with the attachments and you can share the files during replying on the tickets from Faveo. The files will be shared in the reply message on messenger to your clients.

### Support for Google reCaptcha v3
Faveo now supports invisible reCaptcha or reCaptcha v3 by google. In the settings page, you can select the version of reCaptcha you want to use and set up the reCaptcha on your system easily. Recaptcha settings also allow defining places to use reCaptcha like KB comments, login, etc.

### Azure AD support added
We have added additional support in the LDAP plugin to allow using Azure AD. Now you can setup Faveo to import users from you Azure AD and allow your users to login with their Azure account.

### Ticket number assignment
Few clients have reported and we found the rare cases where the same ticket number was being assigned to multiple tickets. It creates multiple duplicates tickets with the same number in the system. We have changed the ticket number settings to fix the issue.
Now in the ticket number setting you can only define the prefix to be used during assigning the id to the tickets. You can also decide and set this prefix for tickets in the workflow. So the tickets that match the workflow condition will have the custom number sequence which is set in the workflow. This allows you to manipulate ticket numbers according to different conditions and set different ticket numbers according to your requirement.

### Ambiguity in account activation and verification logic removed
For a long time, there was confusion in the status of the account in the system. Whether the account is active or verified it was hard to distinguish between them. It does not impact the user login and data in the existing system in any way but it's good that we have figured out the mystery and have it implemented correctly.
Now by default, all the accounts registered in the system will be set as active. No verification is required for activating the account. Agents can simply deactivate and activate the account according to the permission they have.
Verification is now at the entity level, which means that the account is neither verified nor non-verified, it's the email address or mobile number linked to the account which will be verified or non verified. Email/mobile will be verified by default bases on the way or channel from where the users are getting registered in the system. Agents can manually set email and mobile verified from the user's profile the same as before.

### Login and registration process corrected
We have been inspecting our codebase and correcting/refactoring different modules for correct implementation to make our life easier. Though it might not be important for you to know, we wanted to put it out so in case you face issues in log in you can contact us.

### Agents have regained their power
Agents can now again add internal notes on the tickets which they have requested. As in the last release, agents were restricted to not add internal notes on the tickets which they have requested as owner.

### Telephony Plugin v3
The telephony plugin has been updated to v3. Telephony plugin now uses websockets to send the alerts and information about the incoming calls to the logged in agents, if they get a call on their work number via IVR.
The simple popup appears when the call starts and ends with the information of the caller. Agents can add notes by clicking on the popup while they talk on the phone. At the end of the call they can simply create the new ticket for the call or add the call to an existing ticket of the user.

### User account deactivation and added user account deletion
Corrected the implementation of account deactivation in the system. We have also worked on the long requested feature of deleting the user account to make the system compliant with GDPR.

 - #### Account deactivation
Use account deactivation was already available in the system, but it has issues underneath. We worked to fix those issues and make the module more robust and better. Admin have to give permission to agents so that they can deactivate the users and agents. When the user/agents is being deactivated agent might have to select what should happen to the ticket requested by them or the tickets assigned to them.

 - #### Account deletion
Faveo now allows deleting the user account. Deleting users will delete all their personal information and files from the system, such as their contact details, tickets owned by them, the files and images uploaded by them. User account must be deactivated before it can be deleted. Similar to deactivation admin have to give permission to agents so that they can delete the users and agents

This release introduces updates in the LDAP plugin to support multiple AD import. It also updates the task plugin and adds functionality to import users from CSV files.

### Updates
- #### Multiple AD support Added
Faveo LDAP plugin allowed importing users and login via LDAP used by your organization. While previously you could only import all users from single search base and LDAP directory this new update allows you to create multiple LDAP configurations to import and sync users from different directory service databases and with different filters in the same directory.
![Screenshot 2020-08-03 at 3 14 31 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/89170531-66d46a00-d59d-11ea-8963-26013f3c6ba5.png)

When you click on **Configure new LDAP** it will offer you with the same old settings page where you can define your LDAP connection configuration and other settings to filter users and import them to Faveo.

- #### User import via CSV files
    The system now allows importing users from CSV files. Admins can now upload CSV files containing user details and map each column with the user field in the system.
![Screenshot 2020-08-03 at 3 04 30 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/89168669-d137db00-d59a-11ea-8339-7daf83fd44af.png)

### Updates

#### Improved UI of tickets inbox
We have tweaked different elements of inbox and timeline UI to improve the aesthetics of the ticket list and timeline. Functionality remains the same.
![new-timeline](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/79744594-3e916a00-8324-11ea-9fcf-dc101eac1a2f.png)

Now user directory shows the organization column which shows the list of organization users belong. The user directory can be filtered by organizations. 

### Bugs fixed
- Issues in the Twitter plugin
- Missing Business hours timezone if installed via CLI
- Due date comes as null while forking tickets
- Departments can only have up to 4 managers.
- Organization view page breaks when provided with the wrong id in the URL.
- Incoming and outgoing emails issues during fetching emails and sending emails.
- Create ticket API request validation updated.
- Reports do not update with new options after updating the system.
- Queue page UI issue which prevents admin to define custom input to check executable PHP path.

### Changes
- Removed error notification emails sent if the exception occurs in the system as the same is now visible in the admin's dashboard.

In Faveo Helpdesk v3.2.0 the team has squashed various outstanding bugs in the system and introduced multiple enhancements and improvements in the system. 

## What new?

### Dashboard Layout
Faveo now has a new **Dashboard** which focuses on showing agents and admin the information which is relevant to them.  It contains sections like **Require Immediate Attention**, **Todo List**, **Recent Activities** which will help agents to address and efficiently manage the tickets. For department managers, it shows them the performance stats of their department and department members which will help them to make a quick decision for managing their department. See the below image which shows the overall layout of the new dashboard.

### Tags in Knowledge Base
Faveo now allows users to add tags in the KB articles. Linking tags with articles will allow users to find similar articles by creating an additional grouping of similar articles using tags.
You can provide tags while creating or editing an article.

### Improved Logs
System logs have been updated to show more information about the logged data or exception. UI has been updated to segregate filter options on the log level. Cron log has been improved to show the status of cron commands execution to simplify troubleshooting the issues with cron.
![logs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/77815052-c21cba00-70dc-11ea-8b25-e53a015c97b8.png)

### Twitter Plugin #Hashtag support
The Twitter plugin now supports Hashtags. It will fetch the tweets containing the specified hashtags and create tickets in the system. You can provide multiple hashtags to fetch tickets on the plugin settings page.
![hastag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/77815115-8d5d3280-70dd-11ea-9c82-412f9b3c9ce4.png)


## Updates

### Improved plugin settings page
We have changed the UI of the plugin setting page to make it simple to de/activate the plugins.
![plugin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/77815152-2724df80-70de-11ea-8293-1d082843b713.png)

### Secured probe page
Probe page has been secured with the passphrase for security reasons. Now once the system is installed you will need to enter the passphrase to access the probe page as it exposes information about PHP configuration on the server. The passphrase can be found in **.env** file.
![Screenshot 2020-03-28 at 10 31 00 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/77815212-c8139a80-70de-11ea-9e1e-e9c0ffd39dba.png)

### Change status dropdown list
Change status drop-down list now will respect Allow override statutes and will show the results only which are commonly allowed for the selected ticket in case of multiple tickets are selected.

### Improved installer
Faveo GUI installer has been improved and simplified to make the installation experience simple and better.

### Autoupdate refinements


### Laravel v6.18.2
The Laravel framework has been updated to v6.18.2. As Laravel 7 has been released the team will now focus on updating the framework version to 7.X.

## Bug fixes
v3.2.0 squashes various major and minor outstanding bugs and issues in the system. Here we are listing some important bugs which are squashed and probably make you happy to know that they no longer exist.
* The organization logo not visible on the view page or not able to edit the organization due to the organization logo file is now fixed.
* Made language file consistent to make the text on UI consistent.
* Last login time of the user to show the correct login time
* Telephony audio recording not working
* Issues with email fetching and sending
* Various UI bugs and minor bugs
* Issues with approvers in Approval workflow and CAB
* Fixed gravatar image
* Issues with Laravel queue after updating now restating supervisor workers is not required
* Refreshing CSRF token in the backend
* KB search does not work on the words less than 5 characters
* Issue in exporting reports

## Deprecated/Removed

### Deprecated old dashboard layout
Though you can switch to the old dashboard layout we recommend you encourage your agents to use the new dashboard to make themselves familiar with it as the old dashboard will be removed completely in the upcoming releases.

### Removed old inbox layout
We have removed the old inbox layout from the system, now you can no longer switch to the old inbox layout.

### Removed ban user
Ban use functionality has been removed as it was not adding any value to the system and might be not being used by many of Faveo users.

### Removed Close approval workflow
Close approval workflow used to add an extra step of approval before an agent can close the ticket. If close approval workflow is enabled and the agent tries to close the ticket it used to send the ticket in the request for close status and notify the department manager about the action. The department manager then could approve or deny the closing request for the ticket. 
As the same functionality now can be achieved using **Approval workflow** and **Listeners** we have removed the Close approval workflow.

### Removed old social plugin
As we have introduced separate new plugins for Facebook and Twitter we have removed the social plugin.

For technical changelog see https://github.com/ladybirdweb/faveo-helpdesk-advance/blob/master/ChangeLogs.md#v301

|====================================================
|   v3.0.0
|====================================================
Faveo Helpdesk v3 introduces various enhancements and improvements to make your support system better and more secure. In this release, we have improved the system on various aspects from security to performance and business logic implementation.

## What's new?

### Multi-factor authentication
As our dependency on the internet is increasing day by day, we are becoming more comfortable yet more vulnerable on the internet. One of the major threats on the internet is getting the account hacked by attackers. This can be due to people use simple and same passwords for various online platforms.

Multi-factor authentication was introduced as an added layer for securing the login process. In the process of log in the user must provide a private code with their username and password that can only be accessed by them over their phones.

In Faveo we have introduced 2FA login which an individual can enable from his/her profile. Once the 2FA is enabled, whenever the users log in they have to provide a secret code that they can access on their phones using 2FA authentication apps like **Authy** or **Google authenticator**.

#### 2FA setup process

![ezgif com-optimize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/73061399-1ed2dd00-3ec0-11ea-8713-242f05f735fe.gif)

#### 2FA login process
![ezgif com-optimize (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/73061600-8b4ddc00-3ec0-11ea-8b06-d9302f6082aa.gif)

### Projects in tasks plugin

We also updated the task plugin and introduced **Projects** and **TaskLists** which can help you to manage your projects and related task from your helpdesk support system itself. We also changed the UI of the plugin to give it a similar look like other modules. New plugin now
 - Allows to create and manage projects
 - Allows to create task lists and link them with tasks and projects.
 - Allows to create tasks

### Add collaborators in client panel ticket view

If your customers raise tickets and reply to the ticket using the client portal then they might want to add a new collaborator on the ticket while updating the ticket. Also if a user is a collaborator in another user's ticket then they might want to see or update it from the client portal which was not possible in the older versions. But in version 3 we have added this functionality to just give an additional option to your customers.
- CC users of tickets can view tickets and reply to the ticket from the client panel.
- Clients can add new CC users or remove CC users from client panel

### Revamped SLA modules

We have completely revamped the SLA module of the system from its looks to its working. SLA has been improved and optimized for helping you to manage your support system's SLAs. So you can increase your customer base by providing timely support to your customers.

#### Improved SLA UI
We have changed the functionality of the SLA and to make the options easy to understand in new SLA we have rearranged the options in SLA create/edit page.
![SLA_edit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/73063975-1da4ae80-3ec6-11ea-8897-e8c40138c0e9.png)

#### Improved SLA enforcements
The old SLA enforcement process was hard to explain. If anyone asked us how and why this particular SLA has been enforced on the ticket it would take us hours which are directly proportional to the number of SLAs available in their system. This made us rethink the implementation of the SLA enforcement process and we did not waste any time to change the implementation of the SLA. We hope new SLA enforcements will be easy to understand so you can plan your SLA policies better and know why that particular SLA has been applied to the ticket. To see the new working process of SLA search our knowledge base for SLA.

#### Improved SLA reminders
As we have changed the SLA module completely, this includes the reminder and escalation alerts too. Now the system will not skip sending any notifications to you before the ticket gets overdue or no-one responses on the ticket.

NOTE: Version 3 has remarkable updates so once you update the system to version 3 you can not downgrade it to an older version.

For technical changelog see https://github.com/ladybirdweb/faveo-helpdesk-advance/blob/master/ChangeLogs.md

|====================================================
|   v2.3.0
|====================================================
At Faveo we always seek to provide our users with the latest updated tech and functionalities which are available in the market. Keeping our tech stack updated also helps us to serve our clients with an efficient and secure product. Faveo is based on the Laravel framework and uses various frameworks for frontend. We always try to keep our base framework updated to ensure we deliver all the latest updates and security patches.

PHP has released PHP7.4, PHP7.3 is already being used to serve many web applications over the internet. Laravel has released version 6 which is the latest major version released by Laravel developers.

In Faveo v2.3.0 we have updated the framework version to Laravel 6 also made the code compatible with PHP 7.3.  Along with updating frameworks we also improved some existing functionalities and fixed some bugs.

## Enhancements
### Implemented CKEditor 5
The rich text editor is the core of Faveo. It allows agents to send a reply to clients, create useful articles and store predefined templates for a reply. All this is possible due to an interactive text editor provided by CKEditor. To further improve your typing experience we have updated our editors with CKEditor 5. It has a new design and it also lets you upload any image simply by copying and pasting it from your computer after all who does not like to ⌘+c and ⌘+v (ctlr+c and ctrl+v for windows)

### Improved reports
Past and next few releases of Faveo are about Reports because analyzing the HelpDesk data should be interesting and useful for management. v2.3.0 provides various updates in the reports which allow you to 
- Define the format for you custom columns which contain date or timestamps
- Select different chart layout for reports
- View the data categorized in improved widgets

### System backups
System backup allows taking backup of the system including files and databases. Just tell the system to generate a backup for you and continue your day. The system will trigger you a mail when the backup is ready. No more SSH and writing scripts for generating backups.

### PHP 7.3 support
Faveo is now compatible with PHP 7.3, so go ahead and update your PHP version for good.

## Bug Fix
- EWS mail fetching and related issues
- Agent performance redirection issue fixed
- ServiceDesk plugin issues

## Changelog

|====================================================
|   v2.2.7
|====================================================
This release reintroduces change requester and users deactivate functionality in the system. It also offers separate plugins for Facebook and Twitter channels to manage the plugins without hassle.

### Updates
#### Facebook Plugin
The Facebook plugin allows admin to connect one Facebook app to Faveo using the app's API credentials. Once the app is connected with Faveo then admin can create their Facebook page(s) and integrate those pages with Faveo to read and respond on the page messages from Faveo. Messages from all linked Facebook pages will be fetched as tickets and reply made via Faveo ticket timeline will be sent as a reply on Facebook. The new plugin offers better UI to manage and link Facebook pages with Faveo and handles your Facebook conversation more accurately.

#### Twitter Plugin
Same as Facebook we introduced the new Twitter plugin to handle tweets and messages from twitter in a better way. The new plugin allows integrating one developer account app using which Faveo can fetch tweets or direct messages and allows agents to respond to them without logging into logging on Twitter.

#### Helpdesk-In depth Report
In order to improve reporting in Faveo, we have been rewriting our reporting module. This release provides the update for the Helpdesk-in depth report to serve more accurate data for your Helpdesk analysis report.

####  User deactivation and change owner
In past releases, we had removed the User deactivation option and change the requester button to stabilize the codebase. But due to the importance of these functionalities, we have reintroduced these functionalities again in the system.

#### Bug fixes
- Inline images are not being fetched
- Corrected logic for a department manager in the approval workflow

|====================================================
|   v2.0.1
|====================================================
Feature updates

V2.0.1 enhances and provides updates for various features of the system.

## New features
### Ticket Forwarding
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system now allows agents to forward the complete ticket thread via emails. Agents can enter single/multiple email addresses to forward the ticket. It will be useful in cases when you want to share the thread with the third party members without enforcing them to be a part of the ticket.

### Ticket creator field
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New creator field has been added which shows who created the ticket. Most of the time when agents create a ticket for a client system shows the client as a requester of the ticket but there was no information about which agent created the ticket or the client created the ticket themselves. The creator field will solve this issue and tell the actual creator of the ticket.

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filters in inbox and management report also allow filtering the data based on this new field.

   ### Email templates for the department
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faveo uses predefined mail templates for sending email alerts and notifications to users via emails. These templates are editable and can be replicated for creating templates for different languages. So that the users receive emails in their preferred language.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have added the functionality to link template sets with a department which will be used to send notifications emails when any activity happens on the ticket of the department linked to that particular template set.

The previous precedence for the template picked by the system was as shown below
> User's preferred language template set **>** system's language template set **>** default template set

Current update will change template picking preference as below
>User's preferred language and department template set **>** User's preferred language template set **>** system's language and department template set **>** system's language template set **>** default template set

   ### Lanugage Migration Plugin(for internal usage)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An internal plugin to generate language keys with missing translation for a given language which can be later given to translators for translation.

## Updates
### Recurring tickets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recurring ticket allows admin to define a ticket which will be created periodically in certain intervals. While previously this feature can only be used by admin, now agents will also be able to create recurring tickets in the system. However, they will only be able to access their own recurring ticket and will not be able to update system recurring tickets(created by admins) or other agent's recurring tickets. Apart from this, there are a few more updates which are listed below
- Improved data table for showing available recurring tickets.
- Give a name to your recurring event so it will be easy to recognize and edit them later.
- Define execution time for a recurring event. Which means if you want a recurring ticket to be created daily at 2:30 PM now you can set the time for the execution for the recurring event and system will create the ticket at 2:30 PM irrespective of the execution time of recurring cron;

### SLA
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SLA updated for simplifying and centralized backend code
### Approval Workflow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added approval removal functionality and option to select organization managers as approver of levels and approval workflows.
### Listeners
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added option to apply approval workflow in listeners actions.

### Bug Fixes
* Updated email validation
* Ticket preview issue fixed
* Inbox type filter issue fixed
* Datatable UI issue fixed
* Tickets table page number issue fixed
* Ckeditor spellcheck option updated
* Bugs in the approval workflow
* Removed ticket number from the subject while merging the ticket

|====================================================
|   v2.0.0
|====================================================
Vue is a new view

Since Vue is rising its popularity among frontend and full-stack developers, we have started rewriting the code which renders on the client side using Vue for various reasons.

First and foremost it has better compatibility with the Laravel framework which is the core of our application. It also allows us to rewrite small parts of the application, convert them into Vue and release without affecting the whole application or rewriting complete frontend code which may take an eternity.

Version 2.0.0 is our next step towards converting the application into Vue. It converts various parts of the application into Vue integrated modules. Which means we had to make various changes in backend and frontend code. These updates modify the code of some core functions of the application thus the release is tagged as v2.0.0. Although, we tried to make these updates backward compatible with the older version there are few functions and APIs which are not backward compatible after all good things come with some price.

## Changelog

#### Form builder
- All tickets, user, and organizations form builders have been converted to Vue with changes in backend logic to save these customized forms in the database.
- API to get these forms to render and submit have been updated.

#### Forms rendering
- All customized forms of tickets, users and organizations will be rendered as Vue components in agent/admin/client panel.
- Ticket recur, fork and edit form also uses Vue components.

#### Workflows and Listeners
- Workflows and Listeners CRUD has been rewritten with Vue components.
- Workflow enforcements have been updated. Now instead of enforcing the first workflow system will enforce all matching workflows and the final result will contain the last updated values  enforced by last workflow (same goes for listeners)

## How will it impact?

**System** :
- We've refactored and cleaned unnecessarily complex code system will be able to process the request for ticket creation, reply on tickets, etc faster and efficiently.
- All the system related functionalities such as fetching emails, sending notifications, etc will continue to work without interruption.
- As workflow and listeners have few updates in their working it will affect old workflow and listeners in the system.

**Admin/Agents** :
- Admin/Agents will be able to use the system the same as before, the only difference is with the pages which render in the browser will be Vue compiled components.

- Admin/Agents can now view the custom data of the ticket in the single click.

- Admin/Agents can now edit tickets in a single click without opening a separate ticket detail page which opens in a double click on the tickets names.

- As workflow and listeners work slightly different now so Admin might need to recreate their workflows and listeners.

- In some cases, the admin may require to recreate the forms in the system.

**End User** :
- As client panel had already been converted to Vue in the previous version clients will be interacting with the Helpdesk system the same as before.

- Registration page and create ticket page were in Angular js and needed to load a new page previously. Now they have been converted to Vue and will open without redirection or page reload.

**Developers** :
* Since Vue is an easy to learn open source framework with a fairly active community frontend developers can now write components which can be reused in the application by other developers.
* Form builder component is much better than the one written in Angular which gave nightmares to almost everybody who tried to get their hands dirty by editing it.
* Clean backend code with less complexity will help new developers to read and understand the existing code and modify or write new methods without breaking existing functionality.

> Note: All new fixes and enhancements hereafter will be implemented in the updated codebase. The updates will be made available to clients after ensuring the smooth transition of their system from the older versions to v2.0.0 or greater.

|====================================================
|   v1.9.55
|====================================================

|====================================================
|   v1.9.54
|====================================================

v1.9.54 introduces some new features along with the enhancements in existing features and bug fixes.

## Features and Enhancements
  * ### Billing module updates
     Billing module is updated to allow the creation of support packages. This support packages can be used by customers to raise the tickets in your Helpdesk system. Admin can choose whether the support package is required for creating tickets or not.
     #### What's new?
     * Create/update paid or free support packages
     * Define the number of ticket credits which can be created using the package.
     * Define the validity of packages.
     * Package list page for customers to view and select support packages available in the system.
     * Customers can purchase support packages from Helpdesk system.
     * Offline and online payment methods available for purchasing packages.
     * Clients can see all their orders and invoice history.
     * Enable/disable package requirement for ticket creation.
     * Invoice history page for admins and agents with filter options.
     * Agents can manually add payments in the invoice to process the order.
     * Agents can create invoices for users.
     * Send invoices to users via mail.
     * Alerts for new orders and order confirmations.
     * Credits will be deducted from user's order when the raise tickets using package.

  * ### Dynamic navigation sidebar
     We are constantly updating the system to make it more simple and user-friendly for our users so that they do not have to break their head and focus on what is important for them which is provide easy and fast support to their customers. Plus we also want to build the community of developers who can innovate and integrate their work in Faveo. Dynamic navigation implementation helps us to achieve both.
     Now users can easily navigate to different pages like inbox, knowledge base etc browsing from the sidebar all. Developers can use Navigation helper classes to add their pages in the sidebar navigation list.

  * ### Autoupdate
    Although this feature had been introduced in the previous versions, we could not make it reliable and easy for users to update their system using this feature. After updating our billing system recently we have made changes on how we handle licensing for different editions of Faveo.
    We want to make the experience of the users to update their system simple and precise so they do not have to wait for updating their system whenever a new update is released. In order to achieve this, we have reworked on the auto-update module and users will be able to update their system using this feature in the near future.

  * ### Reply to and collaborator updates
    Reply on thread functionality is updated so the users who are making a reply on the thread can choose to whom they want to forward the thread.

## Bug fixes
  * Cron page does not open while the open_basedir restriction is enabled to run PHP scripts in safe mode.
  * Langauge translation does not use fallback words when the translation is not available in the user's preferred language.
  * Handling exception response status in the frontend.
  * Template shortcode invocation method updated.

|====================================================
|   v1.9.53
|====================================================

In the last release as we introduced two separate language packs for Eglish UK and US system started showing the key instead of actual translation for different plugins and modules. This patch fixes the issue and provides updates for some other bugs.

|====================================================
|   v1.9.52
|====================================================
Bug Fixes

Fixed manual activation of the user account by agents. The issue was only happening when the agent user was trying to activate user accounts from the user profile view page.

|====================================================
|   v1.9.51
|====================================================

This release contains the patches for various logical bugs in the system for different functionalities. It also introduces some new features like **Close waiting time** and **Approvals via workflow**.

### Features

- #### Close waiting time
  Many a times client may reply on the old ticket which they have created before a month or a long time ago. There are possibilities that the client replied on the old ticket for a completely new query after the old issue is resolved. This will make it difficult for system users like agent and admins to track the issues raised by the client for different problems as they are replying on the same old thread.
Some companies also want to restrict users response on the closed tickets after a certain time period. Close waiting time allows admin to define a time period till which a client can reply on an old ticket and reopen the same ticket. If the client replied on the old ticket after a defined closed waiting time system will automatically redirect the request to a new ticket and create a new ticket for it.

- #### Approvals via Workflow
Faveo has approvals module which allows defining various approvals on different levels to accommodate the different process of an organization and its department. While in the previous versions agents had to manually apply for the approvals on tickets; now admin can define a workflow which will check for certain conditions to be true in the tickets and then enforce an approval on the ticket. If they match the criteria system will apply for the selected approval on that ticket.

### Bug fixes
- Login page redirection issue in blade files.
- Autoclose module working issue.
- Unable to change default SLA of the system.
- Mobile number validation issue in user view
- CC user duplication issue
- Language images not loading in client panel.
- Email fetch creating duplicate tickets issue.
- Arabic characters missing in the ticket fetched from outlook/office365.
- CLI installer removed order key check.


|====================================================
|   v1.9.50
|====================================================
This release enhances system logs with advanced options to help users or system admin to analyze and troubleshoot any issue occurring in the production environment. It also adds Laravel Horizon which is Laravel's queue monitoring tool which provides a beautiful dashboard to monitor system's background jobs processed in the queue.

### New System Logs

New and advanced System logs provide an organized and beautiful view which provides comprehensive yet easy to understand logs. These logs will be helpful for users/system admins or even Faveo team to analyze what's going in the system and will make it faster to identify and troubleshoot the issues.

  System logs are categorized as below

    Exception logs: All error and exception related logs will be logged here, so when system behaves abnormally you might want to check these logs for finding out the problem or cause of the problem.

    Cron Logs: Faveo has various iterative commands and tasks which it runs using crontab or task schedulers. Next time when the system stops fetching emails or creating recurring tickets these logs may save a few minutes or hours to fix the issue.

    Email logs: Faveo sends and receives emails via system configured mails. These logs will provide complete insight into the email functionality of the system. It will help the user to understand which emails have been fetched in the system, what notifications or alerts emails have been sent out and to whom. All this information will be handy to track system's interaction with the mail server and related activities.

  How to access

  Go to admin panel >System Logs and debugging>System logs

### Laravel Horizon

Faveo uses Queue functionality to process time-consuming or bulk jobs in the background such as sending emails for various user actions like ticket submission or forget password etc. It helps the system to send a quick response to the client to improve their experience on Helpdesk portal. Nobody likes slow or unresponsive webpages when the server is processing their request and doing other various jobs simultaneously. Laravel makes it easy to handle these jobs and push them in a queue so they can be processed in the background.
Laravel Horizon is an open source tool which provides a beautiful dashboard to monitor and manage all jobs which are pushed in the queue. It shows real-time information of the jobs which are being pushed in the queue or being processed or failed while processing. It also provides throughput metrics with information like thee the number of pushed jobs, failed jobs, max runtime of a job etc. It also allows retrying processing of failed jobs.

  How to access

  Go to admin panel >System Logs and debugging>Queue Monitor

### Bug fixes

  * Email template issue fix when agent create the ticket for himself/author-agent then that agent does not receive ticket creation acknowledgment mail
  * System does not pick system default language's template set to send the email notification to users when system default language is not English.
  * Department-status link working in ticket timeline page on double click.
  * Report data getting distorted when exporting management reports.
  * 2019 option to add media modal popup in recurring tickets.
  * database: sync command issue for updating database
  * Handled 404 exception due to calling the URL which does exist in the system using the POST method.
  * LDAP search base allows more than 10 entities.
  * Various UI issues

|====================================================
|   v1.9.49
|====================================================
Hot fix patch

This release provides fixes for some critical issues in the system.

## Bug Fixed

### 2019 Missing?
In add media modal popup's year drop-down list does not show 2019, which makes it difficult to filter out the files which are uploaded in 2019.

### Rating templates shortcodes
Updated system to be able to use more shortcodes in ticket rating and rating confirmation emails to pass more details of tickets such as ticket number, ticket subject etc. in the email.

### Debugbar visibility
In recent updates, the system was not showing debug bar when APP_DEBUG mode is enabled. Also in logs system was logging `production.ERROR: Debugbar exception: Route [debugbar.assets.css] not defined` when running the application. We have made changes in web.php (commit id #db7c7d7fd2f45587e5eb4233d74cad4c8ca45ef0) to fix the issue https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar/issues/387 as per this solution
https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar/issues/387#issuecomment-137487228. As the package has been updated we no longer need this code snippet in web.php and it solves the issue of visibility of debugging bar and error logging.

|====================================================
|   v1.9.48
|====================================================
This release focuses on new features to improve existing functionalities of the system. It introduces CDN enable disable option, report download page and other options which makes the existing functionalities more useful for the users. It also updates the Laravel version to the latest released version of the framework.

## Change Log

### Enhancements
- #### CDN enable/disable option
  Content Delivery Networks widely known as CDN have geographically distributed servers which respond to the requests based on location allowing faster delivery of the resources like images, stylesheets and javascript files. We started hosting resource files of Faveo on our CDN servers allowing your application to handle and respond to the resource requests faster through the nearest server.

  If the user doesn't wish to use resources hosted on CDNs then they can disable the CDN option from the system settings page. It will force the system to handle resource requests and deliver resource files from the same server where the application is hosted. It can be useful if the system is being used in intra network and client machines are not allowed to access resources over the internet.

- #### Report Export download page
  Did not receive the mail after exporting a report from Management reports?
  We have added a new page where you can see and download all your exported reports. Now even if you miss the mail you can still download the report you exported to analyze your system working.

- #### Failure of jobs
  Though we try to ensure that Faveo handles all jobs processed by users without failure. But we have limitations as Faveo is a self-hosted application and most of the times we are not controlling the system which is hosted on user's server. We have added an option in alert and notices which can be used to notify agents/admins about the errors and exceptions occurred in the system. The feature is in early stage and currently it only handles failures occurred during processing of background jobs like exporting reports, creating recur tickets etc.

- #### LDAP package update
  Updated ADLDAP package used in LDAP plugin

- #### Select status which allows auto-closing the ticket
  Faveo has auto-close ticket workflow which closed the tickets automatically after a defined period if the agent had replied on it and there is no response from the client. Previously if you enabled this workflow system would close all the ticket which has last response from agents after a defined period. Which can be troublesome if you are waiting for a response from a 3rd party as the system will close the ticket irrespective of the status.

  New settings in close ticket workflow setting will allow admins to select the list of statuses which allow the system to close tickets automatically. While executing the auto-close process system will check the ticket's status against the list of selected statuses. If the ticket's status matches with any of the statuses from the list then the system will check old conditions to close the ticket and if all conditions satisfy then the system will close the ticket automatically.

- #### Billing updates
  Updated Faveo billing and licensing validation checks to prevent unauthentic usage of the application on client servers without knowledge of Faveo team.

- #### Laravel upgrade
Upgraded Laraved version to 5.7

### Bug Fixes
- Fix redirection issue.
- Ticket body jumbled up
- Cron settings page required field issue
- IE compatibility issue on creating ticket page introduced in the last release
- Updated billing verification link
- Fixed title issue while merging tickets


|====================================================

### Bug fixed
- Timeline page issues
- Forgot password page does not show alert
- Client panel Vue implemented white labeling
- Envato plugin
- User directory and breadcrumbs not rendering `&nbsp;` and showing it as text
- Updated rating mails template to make them work in the different mail client.

|====================================================
|   v1.9.45
|====================================================

### Bug fixes and updates

* **Updated installer:** Updated installer to open probe.php files in the first step to check server environment as laravel route does not load up when system permissions are not correct giving no information about the issue. So putting the system check in simple PHP script will allow the system to check server configuration before giving control to Laravel.
* **Email verification screen is back:** When a user who has not activated his/her account logs into the system, he will be notified to activate the account using the link they received in their mailbox. They are also presented with the option to resend the activation link or update their email before activating the account.
* **Daily report mails issue** Due to the last update in cron settings daily report emails were not going out, which we have fixed in this update.
* **Envato Plugin refinements:** Updated Envato plugin to fix the issues in the plugin
* **LDAP updates:** Added custom port option to connect with LDAP plugin.
* **Fixed client layout** Client layout renders in default theme even after changing the layout colours.
* **Merged template for registration and activation:** In alerts settings now user can select whether they want to send different emails to newly registered users for **registration confirmation** and **account activation** or just a single mail with the merged template.
* **Duplicate ticket numbers issue:** While processing recurring ticket creation jobs system was assigning same ticket numbers to multiple tickets. This patch update will fix the issue by dispatching the recur ticket create jobs on a separate queue. Please note to fix the issue the supervisor configuration needs to be updated.
* **Management report export issue:** Fixed management report issue by updating the export job process and dispatching the job on a separate queue. Please note to fix the issue the supervisor configuration needs to be updated.
* Other UI updates


|====================================================
|   v1.9.44
|====================================================
This release introduces some major updates and features in the system. It updates the Laravel framework to v5.6.39 along with some new features and functionalities in some existing modules.

### Enhancements
  - **Approval workflow module(new)**
    Approval workflow introduces new functionality in the system which allows you to create multiple workflows with multiple levels. You can decide who will approve each level and for each level, you can choose to get approval from multiple people with approval required from all or any of them. Once you have created your workflows with different levels, you can later apply these workflows on the tickets from ticket detail page. When any workflow is applied on a ticket, all approver of level 1 will receive an email to approve or deny the requested ticket and that particular ticket will become unapproved and only privileged agents will be able to perform selected actions on it. Approvers can use the unique link they received in the mail to approve or deny the request without login to the application. Which makes it easy to get approval from the person who does not have an account in the system. If level 1 gets approved then the subsequent level will be enforced and approvers of that level will be notified and it will continue till all the levels defined in the workflow are passed and approved.

  - **Refinements in Language Module**
     * Rewritten methods in LanguageController
     * Updated LanguageMiddleware
  - **LDAP plugin updated with advanced options**
    * Now admin can map attributes from their AD to Faveo database's user table columns. It will allow you to define which column should be imported from your AD and in which column of users table the value should be saved.
  - **Refinements in Cron module**
    * Updated Console/Kernal class responsible for running scheduled artisan commands. Added helper methods for developers so they can handle and schedule their custom artisan commands for the custom module and package from itself.
    * Updated cron settings to let the user select to enable/disable all system's default and plugin's scheduled jobs.
    * Fixed "Daily at" field value to take time in user's system timezone by handling UTC conversion and expected timely execution on severing from the backend.
  - **SLA response flag**
    If the ticket is in halted SLA and response happens on the system by agent then system was not able to set a correct flag for response due. Now while halting SLA system stores the last estimated due date and uses it to set a flag for response due. If the ticket is in Halted SLA and response is done within last estimated due date then the response will be marked on time as true; false otherwise.
  - **Ticket creation with organization**
   As Favoe currently does not have direct linking between tickets and organization we have restricted linking of organization and tickets of users with the role as normal users. Which means you will not be able to create a ticket for internal users(agents/admins) and then link them to an organization.
  - Laravel framework version updated to v5.6.39
  - Updated SLA create/edit page UI
  - Updated Business hours create/edit page UI implemented in Vue.js

### Used Vue.js in more places

### Add custom fields to check enforcement of SLAs
  It enables you to add your custom fields which you created in ticket form to check for specific value. When any ticket created with that value in specified fields it will enforce the SLA.

|====================================================

Faveo had introduced auto update functionality for the system so that our customers can easily update their system automatically whenever Faveo releases a new version, without getting in touch with Faveo support team. The idea behind auto-update is to provide end users with the option to update their system independently without waiting for Faveo Support team to update their system. Initial releases for auto-updates were not working properly and clients were not able to update their system by themselves. This release fixes all the issues with auto-update to ensure hassle free update of your system with the latest released version.


|====================================================
|   v1.9.26
|====================================================
This release is a hot fix release which handle missing scripts in the prevoius release regarding database updates and redis databse.

====================================================
|   V1.9.25
|====================================================

Faveo team is constantly working towards improving existing features in the application along with bug fixing and new enhancements to make the application faster and more user friendly, so you can support your customers easily and in a better way.

To make Faveo more stable and better our team has started inspecting existing features which are the essential part of any Helpdesk system and implementing improved logic to refine the functionality of those features.  There will be frequent releases to roll out those update patches for our customers and these release is the first step towards making our application more stable.

v1.9.25 introduces some improvement patches along with bug fixes.

## Improvements and changelog

### Rethink APIs
In earlier stages of our API development we missed out to follow proper structure for response and parameters. It might seem like a trivial problem but it prevents other developers and coders to integrate their application or use our APIs to build something on top of the Helpdesk. We've rethought this and rewritten our APIs to follow standards of REST APIs. It will allow other developers to collaborate with Faveo team and make new pluigns, to integrate other applications faster and better.
Along with rewriting the APIs we have introduced some new APIs for client users which can be used to access client panel functionality via APIs. To read more about the changes in API please follow our API document.

>**Please note**: Instead of creating new version of API to maintain old integrations our team has reworked on the same old APIs, changed response and parameter structure of the same old APIs(We are still learning). If you have used our APIs in your application, you might want to check the new changes in API to update your application accordingly.
> **Faveo Mobile apps have been updated and updates will be available for download on play store and app store soon**

### Rethink status change
* In a system when you put a ticket on **hold** status and waiting for client reply system will keep the status as **hold** until client replies back on the ticket or an agent manually updates the status.
* Introduced one new status **Unapproved** which will be only visible to certain agents/managers who have permission to see the tickets with this status. This will give you the power to review tickets before your agents see the tickets and start working on it.

### Rethink SLA Policy
Set **HALT SLA** option as *yes* for all default status other than Open as SLA clock should stop when a ticket is closed or deleted as agents are no longer working on those tickets. It helps to evaluate agents performance better and also gives a correct estimation of time spent on a ticket so you can bill your client accordingly.
> NOTE: Updating system will not change the HALT SLA option for existing status please do it manually by editing status to use in your system.

### Rethink reports
* Introduced new report for management teams of businesses which gives complete information of the tickets with data of custom fields raised in the system. This report can be filtered on different criteria and can be exported to excel sheet so management members can see overall system in a glance.
* Fixed issue for calculating *Resolution SLA* in agents and department performance reports.

### Rethink testing
As we want to stabilize the application and make Faveo a bug free product. We are implementing new development process in our team(thanks to our new team members). Each bug and functionality should be written with Unit tests cases, so we can catch the bug before it goes to our testers. It will help us to reduce the bugs in our system and reduce the time to test and release the code, so we can roll out more updates.

## Bug Fixes
* Fixed issues in status SMS sending option (SMS plugin)
* Introduced new templates for calendar plugin to send out task alerts in with specific information
* Fixed issues in status CRUD functionality
* Optimized admin layout by removing unnecessary JavaScript and CSS files.
* Fixed issues in Custom JS plugin (firing inactive scripts)
* Fixed case sensitivity issue in rule/condition check for workflow and listeners.

|====================================================

|====================================================
|   v1.9.23
|====================================================
v1.9.23 is all about performance optimization of the system and bug fixes for older versions.

## Enhancement for better performance
  - Optimized Ticket Tables
      You might have encountered the slow loading of ticket tables as data of customer tickets increase in the system. We have optimized these tables for better and faster experience using Laravel's Eloquent Relationships. It helped us to optimize query execution time and allow us to pass more relevant json data in API requests for getting tickets.

      * Default links for ticket tables will use new Relationship method to render ticket data in your table. If you want to load ticket tables using old query simply put `/old` in the URL of your ticket pages after `tickets`

  - Style sheet and script minification
      We have minified all external/3rd party CSS and JavaScript file along with loading only required scripts on every page to optimize page load time.

## Bug Fixes
 - Added All/Any option to match conditions in workflow
 - Fixed rule execution process for custom fields in Workflow and Listeners
 - Fixed Calendar plugin issues with templates
 - Fixed Knowledge base issues with visibility, article creation and catogry
 - Fixed auto close workflow status issue

|====================================================
|   v1.9.20
|====================================================
Faveo v1.9.20 provides better SLA enforcement options and allows you to define more precise workflow for your HelpDesk system. It has various improvement patches and new functionalities to ensure that your customer's queries are reaching to correct department, with correct priority and SLA plans.

## Enhancement and features
  * ### SLA Enforcement options
    Define multiple enforcement rules for assigning correct SLA plan to tickets and calculate resolve time and resolution time.
  * ### Improved Workflow with more options
    Faveo had the option to define workflow for a ticket where you could define limited criteria to check Subject, email etc. in ticket and based on these criteria you could choose department or set priority or set helptopic of a ticket. This improvement in workflow reduces limitations on criteria(rules) to check and gives you option to define workflow actions based on various new criteria of ticket and user(requester of a ticket).

    PLEASE NOTE: This update may result delete your old workflow rules.

  * ### Listeners
    Using workflow you can check ticket/user fields for certain rules and then define helptopic ,department etc for a ticket which satisfies all defined rules. Workflow is executed only when a ticket is getting created in the system, but many a times you would like to perform different actions on basis of some action already performed on a ticket after creation.
    *Example:*
      > Set status of ticket as "Waiting for response" whenever any agent replies on a ticket
      OR
      > Change priority of a ticket when department is changed.

    Listeners are the set of event and action, which listens for defined events on tickets. Whenever any event takes place in on tickets listeners perform certain actions to update ticket. You can also define rules in listeners along with event and actions and make it more precise.
  * ### Auto spell check
    Editors in the system now has auto spell check functionality
  * ### Support for REDIS
    Now you can use REDIS as your queue to run scheduled jobs like sending outgoing mails etc.
  * ### Dashboard Statistics Settings

This release introduces various new features and enhancements in functionalities which were implemented for customization requests of different clients.
These release contains the update for requirements of `FinCare`, `PSV BANK`, `TILSOL`, `VIVANET` along with many feature enhancements and bug fixes in the system.

**Below is the list of all updates in detail**

* ### Custom forms for tickets are more advanced now
  - As in previous release we'd introduced new form for ticket creation which can be customized completely  for both agent and client panel. In addition to that we've added more default fields which can be used in ticket forms. You can change/add labels to show in both client and agent panel.
  - Now you can also pass parameters in ticket URL to render form with advance options like setting default value for fields in form, allowing clients to edit/fill value in form fields

If you want to give default value of subject in ticket from and your users not to be able provide subject of tickets you can add parameters like below exapmle
> http://faveo-system-url/create-ticket?subject=Pre%20filled%20ticket&subject_writable=1

This will render form like below
![form](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/31535872-4ad92ac6-b01a-11e7-9d31-e923f8f43b5b.PNG)
As you can see `subject` is already filled with the value we passed in parameter and not editable by user.

*  ### Create ticket independently on department or helptopic
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As tickets form can be customized according to requirement, you can remove or add department fields to be shown in ticket form for both client and agent panel.

* ### Google reCAPTCHA
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added google reCAPTCHA in forms to protect your FAVEO system from spam and abuse.

* ### More customized forms are available
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like ticket form we have added  two more forms which can be customized as required.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  - **User/requester** : Allows you to add all custom detail request which you want to get from your cleints like their age, nationality etc.
![user-requester](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/31536514-8a980e14-b01c-11e7-989b-47da4c6eec3d.PNG)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  - **Organization** : Allows you to add more custom fields to get more details about the organizations you add in Faveo system.
![orga](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/31536519-937af51e-b01c-11e7-8589-73a340c53736.PNG)

* ### Link multiple departments to helptopic
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Now you can add multiple departments to helptopic and link them in ticket form. It will allow you to show certain departments linked to a particular helptopic in ticket forms.
![deptb](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/31536640-fea719d0-b01c-11e7-913b-e15ccd0f4001.PNG)
![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10759797/31536676-1adb23a8-b01d-11e7-8858-f5578c889cf7.gif)

* ### Automatically assigen ticket to agents based on location and type(skill)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  You can now add location and type(skills) to agent profiles. These will be used in auto assignment module. All the tickets will be assigned to agents location wise and type wise. For that `type` and `location` fields have been added in default fields of ticket form.

* ### Migrate your support system from `SPICEWORKS` to `FAVEO`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  If you are already using some system for your support/helpdesk and want to migrate to Faveo. Faveo has migration plugin to migrate your all data from your old system to Faveo. Migration plugin currently imports data from two systems which are listed below
    - **Os Ticket**
    - **SPICEWORKS**

* ### Ticket Forking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ticket forking allows you to create duplicate ticket if the tickets whose SLA has breached and still the issue has not been resolved. Forking a ticket will create a copy of ticket with fresh SLA.

* ### Recurring tickets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have a situation where same issue needs to be resolved repetitively then recurring tickets will make this easier for you. It can be helpful for scenarios like creating ticket for recurring bills etc.

* ### Updates in LDAP plugin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previous version of LDAP plugin used to allow users login via their LDAP credentials. We've updated LDAP plugin to import information from LDAP server and use in FAVEO system.

* ### Global access permission
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New permission module was introduced in the last version. Global Access Permission allows agents to see tickets of all departments without belonging to them.

* ### Reassigning tickets permission
